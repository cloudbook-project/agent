# CLOUDBOOK AGENT

The Cloudbook agent component runs in each of the machines of a project and it is in charge of executing the deployable units that the deployer assigned to it.


### Requirements

* Python 3.X
* Windows or Ubuntu (may work on other OS but only designed and tested for these ones)
* Python modules (you can install them with pip3):
	- tkinter (ususally auto-installed with Python 3.X in Windows)
	- flask
	- pynat
	- requests
	- psutil

_Note: any extra library that has to be imported in the code to execute, must be installed previously in the machine (i.e. if you want to run a game that uses pygame you have to install it previousy in each agent machine)_


### Features

The Agent is capable of performing the following tasks:
- Configure itself with the corresponding files: the project configuration file (./distributed/config.json) and its own (./agents/config_agent_XX.json).
- Stay idle until the deployer indicates the DUs to load (./distributed/cloudbook.json) and then load the required DUs overwriting their invoke function for an agent function that knows the IPs and ports of the agents (obtained reading the file ./distributed/agents_grant.json) to be able to send requests to them.
- Launch an http server to allow receiving requests from other agents.
- Create a stats file periodically (./distributed/stats/stats_agent_XX.json) every AGENT_STATS_INTERVAL seconds.
- Create a grant file periodically (./distributed/agents_grant/agent_XX_grant.json) every AGENT_GRANT_INTERVAL seconds.
- Write alarm files (./distributed/WARNING and ./distributed/CRITICAL) when different errors are detected.
- Carry on redeployments when indicated by the deployer with the redeployment files (./distributed/HOT_REDEPLOY and ./distributed/COLD_REDEPLOY). This includes the reloading of the needed DUs and managing the state in order not to produce more alarms than necessary.


### How to use

Despite the fact that the graphical interface has been developed thinking on the ease of use, some instructions and advices are included here in order to help those who do not know how cloudbook works.

* Launching the GUI:
	* Option A)
		1. Double-click the "gui.py" file.
	* Option B)
		1. Open a cmd or shell window.
		2. Navigate to the cloudbook agent folder (the cloned/downloaded repository)
		3. Type `python gui.py` and press enter.  (For more info type `gui.py -help`)

* Creating agents with the GUI:
	1. Select the project tab in which you want create the agent.
	2. Select the tab "Add agent".
	3. Click on the dropdown menu to select the grant level (the power you want to lend to the project).
	4. Click on the button "Select" to choose the folder to the distributed filesystem of the project. You should configure this filesystem before launching the agent to avoid problems.
	5. If you want to create the agent_0 (be careful, only the project owner should create it) tick the checkbox below. Note only one agent_0 can be created per project and machine.
	6. Finally click on the "Create agent" button.

* Launching/Stopping/Removing agents with the GUI:
	1. Select the project tab in which you want to launch/stop the agent.
	2. Select the tab "General info".
	3. Identify the agent you want to manipulate and click the corresponding button ("Launch", "Stop" or "Remove") on the same row. Note that an agent must be stopped to be able to be removed.

* Editing the properties of an agent with the GUI:
	1. Select the project tab in which you want to edit the agent properties.
	2. Select the tab "Agent X" where X corresponds to the row in which the agent is showed in the "General info" tab.
	3. As when creating the agent, select the new Grant and/or folder of the distributed filesystem. Note: it is possible to edit one or both parameters at the same time.
	4. Finally click on the "Save changes" button.

_Important note: the GUI is the most recommended method to control the agent for any action (create, launch, stop or delete)._


### ADVANCED USE (using the console)

It is possible to launch the GUI and the agent through a console command, which admits parameters to modify the default behaviour of these. Here is a small manual for this use. **This is only recommended for developers or advanced users**.

* The GUI has the following possible console syntaxes:

	`gui.py [-verbose]`
	
	`gui.py (-help|-syntax|-info)`

	Example: `gui.py -verbose`


* The agent has the following possible console syntaxes:

	`agent.py create [-agent_0] -project_folder <project_folder> -grant (HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW) [-verbose] [-help|-syntax|-info]`
	
	`agent.py delete -agent_id <agent_id> -project_folder <project_folder> [-verbose] [-help|-syntax|-info]`
	
	`agent.py edit -agent_id <agent_id> -project_folder <project_folder> -grant (HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW) [-verbose] [-help|-syntax|-info]`
	
	`agent.py list -project_folder <project_folder> [-verbose] [-help|-syntax|-info]`

	`agent.py launch -agent_id <agent_id> -project_folder <project_folder> [-verbose] [-help|-syntax|-info]`
	
	`agent.py (-help|-syntax|-info)`

	Example: `agent.py launch -agent_id agent_S4MY6ZGKQRT8RTVWLJZP -project_folder NBody -verbose`

	As it can be seen, each of the functioning modes (create, delete, edit, list, launch) has a different set of possibe options:
	* _Mode 'create'_: allows to create a new agent. A random agent_id will be used unless option -agent_0 is used.
		**[-agent_0]**                          Makes the program create the agent_0 instead a random one.
		**-project_folder <project_folder>**    The name of the folder in which the agent will be created.
		**-grant <HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW>**            The grant level of the agent to be created.
		**[-verbose]**                          Makes the program output traces by console. Intended for debugging.
		**[-help|-syntax|-info]**               Shows create help and terminates.

	* _Mode 'delete'_: allows to delete an existing agent. If it does not exist, does nothing.
		**-agent_id <agent_id>**                The name of the agent to be deleted.
		**-project_folder <project_folder>**    The name of the folder in which the agent is located.
		**[-verbose]**                          Makes the program output traces by console. Intended for debugging.
		**[-help|-syntax|-info]**               Shows delete help and terminates.

	* _Mode 'edit'_: allows to modify the grant level of an existing agent. If it does not exist, does nothing.
		**-agent_id <agent_id>**                The name of the agent to be edited.
		**-project_folder <project_folder>**    The name of the folder in which the agent is located.
		**-grant <HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW>**            The new grant level of the agent.
		**[-verbose]**                          Makes the program output traces by console. Intended for debugging.
		**[-help|-syntax|-info]**               Shows edit help and terminates.

	* _Mode 'list'_: allows to list all the existing agents in a project.
		**-project_folder <project_folder>**    The name of the folder for which agents will be listed.
		**[-verbose]**                          Makes the program output traces by console. Intended for debugging.
		**[-help|-syntax|-info]**               Shows list help and terminates.

	* _Mode 'launch'_: allows to launch an existing agent. If it does not exist, does nothing.
		**-agent_id <agent_id>**                The name of the agent to be launched.
		**-project_folder <project_folder>**    The name of the folder in which the agent is located.
		**[-verbose]**                          Makes the program output traces by console. Intended for debugging.
		**[-help|-syntax|-info]**               Shows launch help and terminates.

	* _No mode_:
		**(-help|-syntax|-info)**               Shows this full help page and terminates.


_Note: the order of the options is not relevant in any of the programs._

_Note 2: remember that the scripts must be run with python3, then you should use the full syntax `python3 <command>` in Unix and `py -3 <command>` in Windows._

_Note 3: unrecognized options will be ignored (you will be alerted though if verbose is ON)._
